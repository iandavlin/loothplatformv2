# Web-craft standard (Ian 6/12: "figure out how this gets fixed permanently")

The disease this kills: basics (image sizing, eager scripts, cache headers)
were re-discovered and re-fixed surface by surface — ~13 rounds on images
alone — because each session's lesson died with its context and "verified"
meant "the screenshot looks right." Screenshots can't see weight.

## The law

1. **Discovered twice → becomes a gate.** Any defect class found a second
   time MUST be encoded as a mechanical check in `tools/gates/` before it is
   fixed the second time. Fixes without gates are rent; gates are ownership.
2. **Gates run, not get remembered.** `tools/gates/run-all.sh` is the one
   entry point. Run it before any push that touches a user-facing surface,
   and as the cut acceptance gate (LIVE-DEPLOY-PLAN Phase D). A red gate
   blocks the push the same way a red visibility matrix does.
3. **Done = green gates**, not a screenshot.

## The craft checklist (what the craft gate enforces)

- **Images**: every same-origin content image goes through the resizer
  (`/img.php?s=…&w=…`) — never a raw `/wp-content/uploads/` original — with
  `srcset` (≥2 widths, browser picks by slot × DPR) and `width`/`height`
  attrs (layout reservation). No image ships >1.7× its rendered pixels.
- **Scripts**: no eager heavyweights a viewer can't use — editors (quill),
  composers, admin tooling load on intent (click/focus), never for anon.
- **Weight**: a page's image transfer stays under budget (gate: 1.5 MB);
  total transfer under 2.5 MB.
- **Caching**: versioned static assets (`?v=`) ship long-lived
  `Cache-Control` (nginx d0457fc pattern).
- **Page furniture**: HTML that must not cache (front page) says so; pages
  carry exactly one h1; lazy-load below-the-fold media.

## Existing gates

| Gate | What it guards | Run |
|---|---|---|
| `profile-app/bin/visibility-matrix.php` | the entire visibility model (66 asserts) | `php profile-app/bin/visibility-matrix.php` |
| `tools/gates/craft-gate.py` | the checklist above, over real pages as anon+member | `python3 tools/gates/craft-gate.py` |

Both run from `tools/gates/run-all.sh`.

## Why this works when 13 fixes didn't

The visibility model stopped leaking the week it became ONE function plus a
test that fails. Nothing else in this project has ever stopped a recurrence.
This document exists to make that the default move, not the last resort.
