# Coordinator handoff — FINISHING THE CUT (2026-06-15, PM)

## ═══ LATEST (2026-06-15, late) — READ FIRST; supersedes the older state below ═══

- **A.3 DONE — dev2 is a SINGLE git checkout of `main`** for ALL apps (bb-mirror, archive-poc, profile-app,
  events, lg-shared) **+ the `/var/www/dev` overlay** (`webroot/`). Deploy = `git pull`. Done via paste scripts
  `.well-known/dev2-a3-stage1.sh` (clone→main + overlay) + `…-stage2.sh` (repoint the 4 app symlinks); each
  smoke-tested + auto-rollback; backouts `/tmp/dev2-a3-stage{1,2}-rollback.sh`. archive-poc `config.json` kept
  app-writable inside the clone. **dev2 == dev verified** (the map regression was dev2 staleness — fixed by this).
- **SEO continuity — DONE, deployed to dev2, verified.** Resolver + sitemap + nginx 301 blocks live on dev2 via
  `.well-known/dev2-seo-deploy-v2.sh` (append-only + nginx-t + rollback). `tools/cut/sitemap-grants.sql` **fixed +
  pushed to main (`d3b3b8c`)**: now CONNECT + schema USAGE + columns (column-only → empty profiles on a fresh PG16
  restore). Re-apply after every profile_app restore.
- **Data top-off done on THIS box's `looth_import`** (`tools/topoff-dev-from-live.sh apply all` → +18 posts/+1 user;
  R2 bucket synced, patreon_avatar excluded). ⚠️ **dev2 top-off is OPEN** — dev2 has its OWN local DBs (local socket),
  so the cut needs a full live dump→dev2 import (runbook §8) OR a one-time live firewall+grant for dev2→live. Decide.
- **Reindex tool FIXED (silently broken since ~6/11):** `archive-poc/bin/backfill-pg.php` TRUNCATEd `tag`+`person`
  mid-txn (built BEFORE the txn) → every tagged post FK-failed → index frozen. Fix: don't truncate tag/person +
  per-tag savepoint. **✅ COMMITTED to main (`f6400aa`) 6/15; deployed on dev1's served copy.** Run
  `backfill-pg.php` THEN `materialize-all.php` (slow, background it) after EVERY restore/top-off or new content won't show.
- **LOGIN "no edit sidebar" — TWO separate bugs:**
  1. **looth_id re-mint bounce (FIXED + ✅ CONSOLIDATED to main 6/15: `d4e0c9c`+`67036b9`+`9a73282`):** old `/wp-json/looth/auth/issue` REST
     mint was doubly broken (BB REST gate `bb-enable-private-rest-apis=1`, re-armed every DB reload → 401; + REST
     cookie-auth needs a nonce a nav lacks → wp-login). Fix = non-REST `/looth-auth/issue` mu-plugin. Branches:
     **lane-wp-auth `7821c3e`** (handler+gate) **+ `bd98773`** (profile-auth.php git←served reconcile — CUT-CRITICAL:
     git was 2wk stale with the email-derived-sub bug; cut deploys from git, so git must carry the served minter) ·
     **lane-profile-app `ebd9b7e`** (repoint config.php + edit.php).
  2. **Responsive editor sidebar (✅ DONE 6/15: `a871ef7`, the drawer) — THIS was Danny West's real bug:**
     `profile-app/web/edit.css:227` → `.rail{display:none}` at `@media max-width:780px`, no toggle → editor sidebar
     vanishes on iPad portrait (768), narrow/split Mac windows, phones. Fix = a drawer/toggle, reachable at every width.
     (Identity/cache were red herrings — server always checked out: whoami authenticated, looth_id fine.)
- **CONSOLIDATION TO MAIN — ✅ DONE locally 6/15 (push held for Ian):** all lane work is on `main` —
  `f6400aa` reindex · `d4e0c9c`+`67036b9` wp-auth · `9a73282`+`a871ef7` profile-app · `b049a7c` GATE 5 wiring ·
  `538b3cf` render · `4bf9962` /u/ hamburger = **8 commits, all today, run-all.sh GREEN 5/5**. Only
  `git push origin main` remains.
- **A.1 (DNS TTL) — MOOT:** loothgroup.com is **Cloudflare-PROXIED**. The "flip" = change the CF **origin IP**
  (old-live→dev2) — instant at the edge, no TTL/propagation wait; rollback = point CF origin back (seconds). Fix runbook A.1.
- **New cut-window paste scripts staged** (`.well-known/`): `dev2-cut-reapply-gotchas.sh` (idempotent grants/ACLs/
  perms re-apply + verify — run after EVERY restore; caught a missing membership ACL on dev2) · `dev2-cut-verify.sh
  <host>` (renders + SEO redirects + sitemap + whoami). **Fold `bb-enable-private-rest-apis=0` into the gotchas script**
  (re-arms every reload; 401s the BuddyBoss REST the header uses).
- **Still open, no downtime:** carry LIVE's JWT keypair to dev2 (salts already staged). Then cut window B–F.

---

Successor: the cut is far along. This supersedes earlier handoffs (in git history). Your job =
a short punch-list + the **SEO/search-continuity build below** + executing the runbook.

## Read order
1. **This file.**
2. **`docs/PHASE-11-CUT-RUNBOOK.md`** ← THE executable cut sequence (A→F). Don't re-derive it.
3. **`docs/dev2-build-checklist.md` → the ADJUSTMENTS LOG = THE TRAP CATALOG** (every build/cut gotcha;
   re-apply its CUT-CRITICAL items at the cut).
4. `cutover/lanes/INDEX.md` (board, 6/13-stale) · `cutover/lanes/RULES.md` · `docs/DEPLOY-PLAN.md`.

## State (one paragraph)
Phase 11. dev2 = prod candidate, built + verified. Method = NEW box + DNS flip, carrying live's
**WP salts + JWT keypair + users/sessions** so logins survive. **A.2 is DONE** — `origin/main` =
`f019434` now holds the entire hub fork + map + genre + cut work (one branch). dev2 is deployed on
`main`. Remaining = the SEO continuity build + the runbook flip.

## ✅ Done this session (6/15)
- **A.2 merge DONE** — `origin/main` `3a5817e → f019434` (118-commit hub fork merged; audited clean,
  gates green, ff-only). **Rollback anchor `pre-a2-main` (3a5817e) on origin** — `git revert -m 1 f019434`
  or reset-to-tag if needed.
- **dev2 deployed on `main`** — pulled f019434; overlay `hub-polish.js`/`pwa.js` cp'd to `/var/www/dev`
  (chown to **www-data** on dev2, NOT buck:loothdevs — those are dev1-only users); genre catalog seeded
  (89). dev2 is the **prod-shaped** box (no dev team users, www-data ownership, R2, env=dev2 host-detect).
- **Live WP salts STAGED** → `/home/ubuntu/cut-staging/live-wp-salts.php` (600, hash-confirmed ≠ dev).
  Apply at cut step 5 (cut-window only).
- **Refresh-JWT verified PASS** — `profile-auth.php` heals absent (init mint) / expired (cookie co-expiry
  → re-mint) / reverse (valid JWT, no WP session → bridges session); wrong-key avoided by carrying live's
  keypair. Session preservation robust given salts+keypair carry.
- **Avatars on dev2**: dry-run = 31 fixable (274 placeholder, rest have no BB photo → stay on Optimum
  default, correct). `--apply` pending Ian. Re-run at cut after the live top-off (idempotent, keep-list #1).
- **Snapshot branch `dev-snapshot-2026-06-15`** (origin) — captured ALL uncommitted multi-lane WIP
  (`9cece1c`) so nothing's lost. Excluded `archive-poc/index.sqlite` (runtime DB). Promote real items to
  main deliberately. The `profile-app/config.php` dev2-env branch is in there (NOT cut-critical — at cut
  the box is loothgroup.com → 'live' branch; dev2 branch never fires).

## 🔍 SEO / SEARCH CONTINUITY (Ian: "don't lose our current search") ✅ BUILT + PUSHED 6/15 PM
**Status:** built, tested on dev1, gates green, pushed. `main` `702a6e4` (nginx 301s + sitemap +
grant script) + `bespoke-cutover` `74ddfd7` (the slug-resolver endpoint). **Dev1 sweep: 982/999
indexed URLs resolve (200/301); ALL forum URLs 301 — the 69% save is in.** What's left = replicate to
dev2 + retest there (the real cut box), then the post-cut re-sweep + GSC sitemap submit. Detail below.

**Risk (why this matters):** the cut changes URL structure; any old indexed URL that 404s loses its Google ranking.
**GSC data:** `live-bundle/loothgroup.com-Coverage-2026-06-15.zip` (summary) +
`lg-snippets/loothgroup.com-Coverage-Valid-2026-06-15.zip` → **`Table.csv` = the 999-URL indexed list**.
- ~**1,208 indexed**, ~**270 impressions/day**, growing. Mostly-gated site (5,225 not-indexed = 2,590 thin
  + 1,344 intentional noindex + 629 already-redirecting + 372 canonical-dupes + 151 already-404).
- **Of the 999 valid URLs, 69% are old bbPress forum/group topics with NO redirect:**
  - **372** `/all-forums-all-topics/topic/<slug>/`
  - **316** `/groups/<group>/forum/topic/<slug>/`
  - → would **404 at the cut = lose ~69% of search.** THIS IS THE #1 CONTINUITY ITEM.
- **Already fine:** content CPTs slug-preserved & unchanged (post-type-videos 116, loothprint 66,
  post-imgcap 14, sponsor-post 7, event 17, etc.); forums→hub is `301` ✓.
- **Members:** only **6** indexed; their redirect is **302 (should be 301)**.

**✅ What was built (all in `702a6e4` / `74ddfd7`):**
1. **Slug-resolver (the big save)** — `bb-mirror/api/v0/seo-redirect.php`. Topic slugs are GLOBALLY
   UNIQUE (1284/1284), so `t.slug=:s` → forum is deterministic. `<slug>` → **301 `/hub/<forum>/<slug>/`**;
   forum slug → **301 `/hub/<forum>/`**; unknown → **301 `/hub/`** (NEVER 404). PG-only, bb-mirror pool.
2. **nginx redirect rules** — `platform/nginx/strangler-bb-mirror.conf`: `/all-forums-all-topics/topic/*`,
   `/groups/*/forum/topic/*`, `/groups/*/forum/<f>/<t>/`, forum landings → resolver; reply/topic-tag/
   bare-group → `/hub/`. All 301. (Resolver is gated on dev for testing; cut removes the gate → public.)
3. **Members 302→301** — `platform/nginx/strangler-profile-app.conf`: `/members/<slug>` → `/u/$1`,
   `/members/` → `/directory/members`. Kept `/members/me` + `profile/edit` as 302 (login convenience).
4. **Sitemap** — `archive-poc/web/sitemap.php`, UNGATED like robots.txt, host-relative (correct on dev
   now + loothgroup.com at cut). Index → static + content (630; `content_item` tier IN public,lite,
   excl `sponsor-product`; **note: `pro` paywalled tier omitted** — judgment call, the handoff's literal
   "public/null" predated the public/lite/pro vocab) + profiles (1,904; `profile_app.users`
   `profile_visibility='public'`). Needs a **column-scoped `profile_app` grant** → `tools/cut/sitemap-grants.sql`
   (re-apply after every profile_app PG restore, like forums-grant).
4b. **Bonus redirects** — `/mobile-archive-page/*` → `/archive/` (retired CPT), `/sponsor-page/<s>/` →
   `/sponsors/<s>/` (old permalink). Also reconciled `archive-poc/nginx-snippet.conf` source→deployed
   (folded prior deployed-only drift: `event` CPT + `location = /` home page).
5. **robots.txt** — STAGED `/home/ubuntu/cut-staging/robots-live.txt` (points at sitemap, disallows app/
   account surfaces). Swap in at **cut step 13** (replaces dev's `Disallow: /`). Unchanged this session.
6. **noindex** stays on gated/member content (hub topic pages have no noindex → 301 targets index fine).

**⏳ What's LEFT (not done):**
- **Replicate to dev2 + retest there** — built/tested on dev1. `platform/nginx/*` rides git pull, but
  dev2 needs: archive-poc deployed snippet (`/etc/nginx/snippets/strangler-archive-poc.conf`), `sitemap.php`,
  and the `profile_app` grant applied; then re-run the sweep. dev2 is the actual cut box — this is the
  meaningful pre-cut test.
- **Post-cut** — re-run the 999 `Table.csv` sweep (the **9 event 404s should flip to 200** after the data
  top-off + reindex materializes them) and **submit the sitemap to GSC**.
- **Residual (acceptable):** ~8 genuinely-gone URLs (expired sponsor promos, one numeric-ID old permalink
  `/post-type-videos/69216/`, one root-level old permalink, an `/archive/N/` pagination URL). Deleted
  content correctly 404s — left as-is.

## ⚠️ Remaining punch-list (priority order)
1. ~~SEO continuity build~~ ✅ DONE + pushed (`702a6e4` / `74ddfd7`). REMAINING: replicate to dev2 +
   retest there (archive-poc snippet + sitemap.php + profile_app grant), then post-cut re-sweep + GSC submit.
2. robots.txt swap stays a **cut step 13** action (staged, unchanged).
3. The runbook flip (A→F): salts/JWT carry, freeze+top-off, gotcha re-apply, URL+DNS flip, verify.
4. Re-run avatar backfill + the data top-offs at the cut window (keep-list).
5. Promote `profile-app/config.php` dev2-branch to main IF you want dev2 testable as 'dev2' (not cut-critical).
6. INDEX loose ends: forum-visibility gate 4/4, reconcile-pg timer, doc archive.

## Staged / on-box artifacts
- `/home/ubuntu/cut-staging/live-wp-salts.php` (600) — live salts (step 5, cut-window only).
- `/home/ubuntu/cut-staging/robots-live.txt` — live robots.txt (step 13).
- `/etc/looth/jwt-{private,public}.pem` — JWT keypair (carry live's at cut, step 6).
- `backups/looth_import_*.sql.gz` · `tools/topoff-dev-from-live.sh` · `docs/CUT-DAY-DATA-TOPOFF.md` ·
  `tools/cut/forums-grant.sql` (re-apply after every PG restore).
- GSC exports: `live-bundle/…Coverage…zip`, `lg-snippets/…Coverage-Valid…zip` (Table.csv = indexed URLs).

## Landmines / don'ts (standing — full catalog in the ADJUSTMENTS LOG)
- **DNS + `WP_HOME`/`SITEURL` flip in the SAME window** — never DNS alone.
- **Re-apply after ANY PG restore:** forums-grant + `chmod o+x /home/ubuntu` + pool env overrides
  (CONFIRMED 6/14: grant didn't survive dev2 restore → member 500s).
- **Reindex archive-poc AFTER the URL flip** (else bakes `dev2`).
- **SEO redirects must be `301`, not `302`** — 302 keeps Google on the OLD URL (no equity transfer).
- **Overlay deploys go LIVE→git, never reverse** (don't cp the stale `hub-overlay-flag` fork over live).
- **⚠️ AVOID DEPLOYING A STALE OVERLAY (forward, to dev2/live):** `hub-overlay-flag/*.js` in git is a
  *snapshot* of dev1's live `/var/www/dev/*.js` and **drifts** (buck/anyone hot-edits live). Before
  `cp hub-overlay-flag/* → <target>/var/www/dev/`, **RE-CAPTURE from live dev1 first** (or `cmp` each
  file vs dev1's live copy and re-fold any that differ) — else you ship an old overlay. Fold currency
  as of this handoff: **hub-polish.js / pwa.js = v200 (6/15)**; treat anything older in `pwa.js`'s `?v=`
  as the canary. Same rule for `directory-*.js`, `mobile-hub.*`, `app-*.js`, `sponsor-cards.js`.
- **Don't merge the snapshot branch wholesale** (`dev-snapshot-2026-06-15` holds mixed multi-lane WIP +
  the dev2-config branch) — cherry-pick individual files to `main` deliberately, never `git merge` it.
- **`≥641`-only CSS leaks onto mobile** (shared card markup) — ship the `≤640` complement same change.
- **Conversion re-run = duplicate post** (must be idempotent). **No secrets in `.well-known`.**
- **`wp user delete` = cross-store NUKE** — direct SQL only. **loothtool = out of scope.**
- One dup-email member (mikelle.davlin wp 1848/1905) — whitelist at bridge-backfill. **No push without Ian's review.**

## Rollback
DNS is the master switch (revert `loothgroup.com` A → old-live, TTL low; old-live's `WP_HOME` unchanged).
A.2 rollback: `git revert -m 1 f019434 && git push`, or reset to tag `pre-a2-main`. dev2: `git checkout` back.
